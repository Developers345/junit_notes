## What is Unit Testing?

The process of conducting the testing by the developer **himself** in certifying that the code he has written is working properly and ready for testing in order to deliver it to the QA for further testing is called **"Unit Testing"**.


## How to Conduct Unit Testing?

The developer, upon developing the component or program, has to test the component by himself manually.

1. Take a fixed or pre-defined set of inputs which are required for conducting the testing.  
   These are called **"Test Fixtures"**.
2. Based on the pre-defined inputs, manually compute the expected output by evaluating the program logic.
3. Execute the program with the pre-defined set of inputs (**test fixtures**).
4. Verify whether the output generated by the program execution matches the expected output or not.  
   - **If matching** → mark the test as **passed**.  
   - **If not matching** → mark the test as **failed**.


## Example

```java
class Calculator {
  public int add(int a, int b) {
      return a + b;
  }
}

class Test {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // test fixtures
    int a = 10;
    int b = 20;

    Calculator calculator = new Calculator();
    int sum = calculator.add(a, b);
    System.out.println("sum : " + sum);
  }
}
````
In this way, we need to conduct the testing with all possible combinations of inputs and verify whether the program is producing the expected output or not.  
These combinations with which we conduct the testing are called **"Test Cases"**.
